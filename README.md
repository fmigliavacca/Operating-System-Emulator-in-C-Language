# Operating-System-Emulator-in-C-Language
I developed an Operating System Emulator using the C programming language. The emulator is organized into four functional modules, each designed to simulate critical aspects of an operating system:

Input/Output Components: This module handles the simulation of input and output devices, including user interaction and data flow between the system and external peripherals.

CPU: The CPU module emulates the processing unit, managing the execution of instructions, handling task switching, and ensuring efficient computation.

Kernel: Serving as the core of the emulator, the kernel manages system resources, schedules processes, and oversees communication between modules to maintain seamless operation.

Memory Management: This module is responsible for simulating memory allocation, deallocation, and ensuring optimized access to memory resources for running processes.

The project aims to provide a deeper understanding of operating system principles through a practical, modular approach.
